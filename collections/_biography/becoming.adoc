In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged
as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of
the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that
role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history.

While also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls
in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families
pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he
led America through some of its most harrowing moments.

Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and
raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare.

In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling,
Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences
that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to
her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work
to her time spent at the world’s most famous address.

With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her
disappointments, both public and protected, telling her full story as she
has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and
revelatory.

Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance
who has steadily defied expectations — and whose story inspires us to do the
same.
